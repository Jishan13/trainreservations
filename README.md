# trainreservations
This application was the final project for CS336 at Rutgers University New Brunswick. This was a group project written using Java, HTML/CSS, JSP, Apache Tomcat, MySQL, and AWS EC2. The goal of this was to create a database and have users interact with it; admin functionality, account registration, train schedule browsing, and customer representative features are included.
